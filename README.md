# Home Assistant Weather Station Integration for TRMNL

This weather station is available as a HACS integration, alongside a TRMNL E-Ink display plugin.
Its primary purpose is to visualize CO2 and Temperature data from a Netatmo weather station.

## Key features:

* Automatic discovery of the weather station
* Support for selecting specific devices

While currently tested only with Netatmo, extending support to other weather stations should require minimal effort.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress.
