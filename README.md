# TRMNL Home Assistant Weather Station 

Use your **TRMNL** display to monitor **live CO₂ levels and up to four custom weather sensors** from your **Netatmo** or other supported stations.

This lightweight Home Assistant integration delivers your data to the TRMNL E-Ink display via the included plugin, for low-power, glanceable monitoring in your home.
