# Home Assistant Weather Integration for TRMNL

This integration is available as a HACS plugin, alongside the TRMNL E-Ink display plugin.
Its primary purpose is to visualize data from a Netatmo weather station.

Key features include:

* Automatic discovery of the weather station
* Support for selecting specific devices

While currently tested only with Netatmo, extending support to other weather stations should require minimal effort.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress.
